History
________________


I started university, software engineering, in September 2009.
I studied up to June 2010, then I was hired in Global Base srl.
Specific key accomplishments in Global Base srl
In a first period, from June 2010, I’ve followed Google Maps technology-based projects. In this case backends are supported on LAMP.
During these projects I’ve developed a JavaScript library for handling large amounts of markers on Google Maps and tuning these performance.
From Jan 2011 I was assigned on all business projects developed on the Google App Engine PaaS.
All these projects were developed are based on SOA with JAX-RS.
Continuously I support the maintenance of our corporate LAN and Linux virtual machines hosted on VMWare ESXi.
I’m currently training new employees, training target is the development of SOA solutions on Google App Engine and Amazon Web Services.
Since the beginning of 2013 I’m working on enterprise portal solutions with Liferay that run on Amazon Web Services and the management of deploy with Git.
